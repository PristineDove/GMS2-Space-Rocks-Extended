	<b>Spawn by Time</b>

	<p> 
	Remember to pick only Spawn by Score or Spawn by Time as these do not work together, it is one or the other.

<p> 
	First lets remove launching rocks from <tt><b>obj_game: Start Room</b></tt> event.  Comment out calling <tt><b>scr_sqawn_asteroid</b></tt>:
	<h3><tt><b>obj_game: Start Room</b></tt> event</h3>

<p>
	<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH2/CommentOutLaunchingFromRoomStart.png" alt="Comment out rock spawning in obj_game Start Room event">

<p> 
	I want to launch two large rocks at the player.  I want to give them time to get used to the controls and playing the game.  I am assuming they have never played a game like this before.  So I will not hit them on the first wave.  I want the rocks after they screen wrap once to kill the player if by then can't figure out how to fly out of the way from the center.  I don't want the player to die right away and I don't want them to be lazy and never have to move. This is an intentional balance I am trying to create.

<p>

<p>
	We could use alarms to spawn in the future but we only have 12 alarms.  This is not nearly enough to handle all asteroids we want to spawn.  

	<p>
	<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH2/Only12AlarmsTotal.png" alt="Show only 12 alarm events">

<p>
	There is another resource in GameMaker that we can use.  It is called <b><a href="gms2tutorials:///ShowHelp?tag=timelines">timelines</a></b>.  A timeline allows us to launch as many scripts as we need over time. Right click on the <t><b>Timelines</b></t> header in the <tt><b>Resources</b></tt> menu and select <tt><b>Create Timeline</b></tt>.

<p>
	<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH2/CreateNewTimeline.png" alt="Create a new timeline">

<p>
	Name this new timeline <tt><b>tl_asteroid_launching</b></tt>.

<p>
	<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH2/tl_asteroid_launching.png" alt="Name new timeline tl_asteroid_launching">
	
<p>
	Press the <tt><b>Add</b></tt> button and it creates a new <tt><b>Moment</b></tt> that is set to <tt><b>0</b></tt>.  We also see a script that is called <tt><b>moment_0</b></tt>.  A moment is at what point in frames is this script run (it is only run once unless the timeline is restarted).  Remember the room is set to 60 fps if you followed the tutorial so 60 will be 1 second long.  Lets wait a short beat before we launch the first rocks.  

<p>
	<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH2/TimelineAddMoment.png" alt="Add moment to timeline">

<p>
		Right click on <tt><b>Moment 0</b></tt> and select <tt><b>Change Moment</b></tt>:

<p>
	<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH2/ChangeMoment0.png" alt="Change moment in timeline">

<p>
		Now a cursor appears so you can edit this number. Instead enter the number <tt><b>10</b></tt> (frame 10 or 1/6 of a second).

<p>
	<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH2/ChangeFirstMomentTo10.png" alt="Add 10 to timeline">
	
<p>
		Lets launch the two rocks that we outlined previously.  These will be two <tt><b>spr_asteroid_huge</b></tt> sprites.  
		
<p>
	The first is in the top left corner of the screen which makes it an <tt><b>x_pos</b></tt> of <tt><b>0</b></tt> and <tt><b>y_pos</b></tt> of <tt><b>0</b></tt>.  An angle of -45 woudl hit the player and we want to miss them so we launch it as <tt><b>-30</b></tt> degrees at its default speed so we multiply it by <tt><b>1</b></tt>.

<p>
		The second is off the bottom and 3/4 of the way across the screen.which makes it an <tt><b>x_pos</b></tt> of <tt><b>0.75</b></tt> and <tt><b>y_pos</b></tt> of <tt><b>1</b></tt>.  We launch it at an angle of  <tt><b>100</b></tt> degrees at its default speed so we multiply it by <tt><b>1</b></tt>.

<p>
	<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH2/LaunchFirstWaveAt10.png" alt="Luanch 2 rocks at moment 10">

	<p>
		Now each object has a timeline. So we will use our <tt><b>obj_game</b></tt> and use its timeline.  It is not an object that the player interacts with and is not destroyed so we know the timeline will keep playing.  

	<p>
		Now this timeline is not linked to the one you created.  Just like our sprite has <tt><b>sprite_index</b></tt> to set a new sprite, we also have a <b><a href="gms2tutorials:///ShowHelp?tag=timeline_index">timeline_index</a></b> varible. It's default value is <tt><b>-1</b></tt> which means that it is not set to any timeline.  We set it simply by
		<h3>timeline_index = tl_asteroid_launching</h3>

	<p>
		We want to start from the begining of the timeline. There is a variable called <b><a href="gms2tutorials:///ShowHelp?tag=timeline_position">timeline_position</a></b>.  We will set it to the begining (just in case it is not there) by
		<h3>timeline_position = 0</h3>

	<p>
		Finally we have got to tell the timeline to start running (it defaults to false which is paused/off). There is a boolean variable called <b><a href="gms2tutorials:///ShowHelp?tag=timeline_running">timeline_running</a></b>.  We will set it to true:
		<h3>timeline_running = true</h3>

	<p>
		So open <tt><b>obj_game: Room Start</b></tt> event and add to the bottom:

		<h3><tt><b>obj_game: Room Start</b></tt> event</h3>
	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH2/LaunchTimeilne.png" alt="Start timeline in obj_game roomstart event">

	<p>
		Run the game by pressing the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Shared/Icon_RunProject.png" alt="Play button icon"> <tt><b>Play Button</b></tt>. Watch the below carefully.  The rocks should launch after a very short delay and follow the path that was in the diagram. The rocks miss the player on their first pass but wipes it out on the second pass if they don't move. It should look like:
			
	<p>
			<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH2/FirstWaveTimelineInGame.gif" alt="Run game and see first two waves of rocks">			

	<p>
		Run the game by pressing the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Shared/Icon_RunProject.png" alt="Play button icon"> <tt><b>Play Button</b></tt>. Try and shoot all the rocks.  You can destroy the two rocks fairly quickly and the medium rocks don't take long.  It takes a bit more time to kill the smallest rocks.  

	<p>		
		Lets make it tougher on the player at the 10 second mark (10 * 60 = 600th frame). Here is what I propose in launching 2 medium size rocks.  We will leave the speed at its default multiplier of 1 (its base amount).  Try and convert this diagram into script before scrolling down to the next step in the tutorial. You can check to see if you matched the diagram or not?

	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH2/SecondWaveAsteroids.png" alt="Illustration of next two medium rocks">

	<p>		
		So the above illustration will look like below (order doesn't matter).  You get this by pressing the <tt><b>Add</b></tt> button and right clicking on <tt><b>11</b></tt> and select <tt><b>Change Moment</b></tt> and change it to <tt><b>600</b></tt>.  Add the following script to launch two medium asteroids at regular speed: 

	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH2/SecondWaveScript.png" alt="Add moment to 300 and launch 2 more medium rocks">
		
	<p>
		Run the game by pressing the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Shared/Icon_RunProject.png" alt="Play button icon"> <tt><b>Play Button</b></tt>.  Ten seconds in you should see the two rocks enter in the way that we planned it out.  
		
	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH2/SecondWave.gif" alt="See second wave of rocks">
			
	<p>
		For tuning I think it would be useful to have a clock so I can see how fast I can clear out rocks to plan my timing.  Lets add the time by using the <b><a href="gms2tutorials:///ShowHelp?tag=timeline_position">timeline_position</a></b>.  This gives us what frame it is at.  If we divide this by <tt><b>room_speed</b></tt> and remove the fraction by flooring this value, we will get seconds.  Open <tt><b>obj_game: Draw </b></tt> event and add:
		<h3><tt><b>obj_game: Draw </b></tt> Event</h3>
	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH2/DrawTimeInRoom.png" alt="Add timer to hud in obj_game draw event">

	<p>
		Run the game by pressing the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Shared/Icon_RunProject.png" alt="Play button icon"> <tt><b>Play Button</b></tt>. You will now notice that it counts up in seconds.

	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH2/HudWithTime.png" alt="Run game and now we have a counter">

	<p>
		Play the game with the clock and find out the timing for a larger two stage wave.  This is what I am thinking.  Try to implement this yourself before moving to the solution in the next two steps.

	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH2/ThirdWave.png" alt="Diagram of third wave">

	<p>
		Add two more entries to <tt><b>tl_asteroid_launching</b></tt> timeline at 20 seconds (1200 frames) and 25 seconds (1500 frames).

	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH2/ThirdWaveTimelineI.png" alt="Add a moment and script at 1200 frames">
	<p>

	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH2/ThirdWaveTimelineII.png" alt="Add a moment and script at 1500 frames">

	<p>
		Run the game by pressing the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Shared/Icon_RunProject.png" alt="Play button icon"> <tt><b>Play Button</b></tt>.  Start playing the game.  Woops, now that we are scoring more points and there are more rocks we are winning long before it is over:

	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH2/WinTooEarly.png" alt="Play game, notice we are winning too soon">

	<p>
		Lets count up how many rocks we have.  We are spawning 4 huge asteroids and 6 medium ones.

	<p>
		Open <tt><b>obj_game: Create</b></tt> event and add a variable to the bottom called <tt><b>win_score</b></tt>.  
	<p>
		Now each large rocks spawns two medium rocks which then spawn 2 small rocks each.  This adds up to 250 points for each large rock we spawn.  

	<p>
		A medium rock spawns 2 small rocks so this adds a total of 120 points per medium rock.  Total these all up so you have to destroy all of the rocks to win.
	
		<h3><tt><b>obj_game: Create</b></tt> Event</h3>
	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH2/AddWinScoreToGameCreate.png" alt="Figure out total score and add it to new variable win_score">
		
	<p>
		Open <tt><b>obj_game: Step</b></tt> event and look to see where we check for our winning score.  Change our hard coded value to the variable <tt><b>win_score</b></tt>. 
	<h3><tt><b>obj_game: Step</b></tt> Event</h3>

	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH2/UnhardCodeWinCondition.png" alt="Add win_score to step event in obj_game">
		
	<p>
		Run the game by pressing the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Shared/Icon_RunProject.png" alt="Play button icon"> <tt><b>Play Button</b></tt>.  Start playing the game.  Now you should be able to play it to the end and you win after killing the last rock!

		That's it, all you have to do is craft a MUCH longer experience.  Make this a lot longer and Have fun!
